## [Android] Why does LruCache use LinkedHashMap?

1. LinkedHashMap consist of HashMap and Double LinkedList, so that it not only stores Key-Values just like HashMap, but also records the order in which elements are inserted.

2. When we create a LinkedHashMap, we can choose its structure by a field `accessOrder`. `true` means that LinkedHashmap stores elements by visiting order, the elements which be visited will be put in the end of it; On the other hand, `false` means it will stores elements by inserting order.  
A LikendHashMap that stores elements by visiting order fits LRU algorithm exactly.

3. Method `trimToSize` in LinkedHashMap will not stop deleting the first elements in the LinkedHashMap until the size of the map is less than or equal to the maximum size of the cache.

## [Android] Binder Working Mechanism

## [Java] Abstract Class or Interface?

Abstract Class: is-a, that means the subclass is a "Abstract Class", the subclass inherits the properties and methods of its super class.

Interface: has-a, means the subclass has a "Interface", the subclass just has the methods of the interface that it implements.

Because of "Interface oriented programming", interface is more popular than abstract class in *design pattern*. Interface is the way that Java uses to accomplish multiple inheritance.

In conclusion, I think that if the properties are neccessary, and the subclass must inherit the properties of its super class, choose abstract class. Otherwise, choose interface.

## [Alorithm] Permutations

Description: Given a collection of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.

### Code 

```
    public List<List<Integer>> permute(int[] nums) {

        List<List<Integer>> lists = new ArrayList<>();
        permute(lists, new ArrayList<>(), nums, 0);
        return lists;
    }

    private void permute(List<List<Integer>> lists, List<Integer> list, int[] nums, int offset) {
        if (offset == nums.length) {
            lists.add(new ArrayList<>(list));
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i <= offset; i++) {
            list.add(i, nums[offset]);
            permute(lists, list, nums, offset + 1);
            list.remove(i);
        }
    }
```

### Process

example: Input [1,2,3]

1. add (0,1) -> [1]
2. add (0,2) -> [2,1]
3. add (0,3) -> [3,2,1]
4. del (0) -> [2,1]
5. add (1,3) -> [2,3,1]
6. del (1) -> [2,1]
7. add (2,3) -> [2,1,3]
8. del (2) -> [2,1]
9. del (0) -> [1]
10. add (1,2) -> [1,2]
11. add (0,3) -> [3,1,2]
12. ...

The process is just like using DFS to get the deepest place of a tree to get a case, and then backtrack, get another case till getting all cases of the node, and then backtrack again, repeat the process till all cases of the tree.
